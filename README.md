# Lekker

**ðŸš¨ Work in progress. Not ready for consumptionðŸš¨**

Control sex toys using your tongue. Lekker tracks your face in real time using the True Depth camera. To control the toys, you stick out your tongue to "lick" a virtual 3D heart shown in the app. The rate, intensity, and duration of your actions against the virtual heart determine the vibration strength of the real world toys.

### Request a feature
If you have any ideas on how Lekker could be improved, please [submit a feature request][newIssue].

If there you'd like to see another toy supported, either:

- Submit a PR that adds support.
- Or send my a new copy of the toy (along with relevant API documentation) so that I can integrate support into the app.


### Code
Lekker is written in TypeScript and uses React Native. The general structure of the project is:

```
heart/ â€” Webview content that displays the heart
    src/ â€” Source for the webview

mobile/ - React native application
    ios/ - xCode project and native source
    src/ â€” TypeScript sources
```

**Building the heart webview**

The heart webview lives under `heart/`. The output is an html page that displays the 3D heart using WebGL (it uses a webview because I couldn't figure out how to code it in scenekit fast enough). To build it:

```bash
cd heart
npm install
npm run compile
```

This compiles the files in `heart/src` to `heart/dist`. Start a local server to view the heart:

```bash
npx http-server .
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080/`

**Building the mobile app**

The main iOS application is under `mobile/`. To build and run the app:

```bash
cd mobile
npm install

# Compile TS
npm run compile 

# Start app
npm start
```
